# Sectors

Sectors is a simple desktop task manager built for focus.
It uses time buckets instead of one long list. You drop tasks into clear zones so you see what matters now and what can wait.
It is inspired by **Carl Pullein’s Time Sector System**, adapted into a desktop workflow.

## How it works

Sectors gives you fixed buckets:

* Inbox
* Today
* This Week
* Next Week
* This Month
* Next Month
* Long Term
* Routines

Tasks sit in one bucket at a time. You move them forward as you plan your week.
This keeps the load clear and stops list overload.

## Features

* Time-based task buckets
* Tags, priorities, and due dates
* Notes for each task
* Fast search
* Routine tasks with auto-generation
* Local storage on your machine
* Clean layout with calm visuals
* Goals
