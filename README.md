# Sectors
A simple desktop task manager built for focus. Organize tasks into time-based sectors instead of one overwhelming list, so you can see what matters now and what can wait.
Inspired by Carl Pullein's Time Sector System, adapted for desktop workflows.

## How It Works
Sectors organizes your tasks into clear time horizons:

- Inbox - Capture everything first
- Today - What you're doing today (2+8 priority system)
- This Week - Tasks for this week
- Next Week - Next week's work
- This Month - This month's projects
- Next Month - Planning ahead
- Long Term - Future goals
- Routines - Recurring tasks

Tasks live in one sector at a time. Move them forward as you plan your day and week.

## The 2+8 System

- Maximum 2 Must Do tasks
- Up to 8 Should Do tasks
- Unlimited Could Do tasks

This constraint forces you to choose what truly matters each day.

## Quick Start
- Add tasks to your Inbox
- Process the Inbox - move tasks to appropriate sectors
- In Today, pick your 2 Must Do tasks for the day
- Work through your list and check off completed tasks
- At day's end, move unfinished tasks to the right sector
